# View
### Responsibility
Views are responsible for rendering content and handling user interaction with that content.

### Key Considerations
* Views are responsible for the styling and layout of user interface components.
* Views are a visual representation of their models.
* Custom views that are composed of other views define an interface for configuring display properties of their contents through their [view model](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-style-guide/blob/master/ViewModel.md).
* For some views, user interaction is communicated to controllers through delegation or closures.
* For views that inherit from `UIControl` (such as `UISwitch`, `UIButton`, `UISlider`, etc...), user interaction is communicated via a [target-action](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/TargetAction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009071-CH3) mechanism to notify your app when an interaction has taken place.
* The [target-action](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/TargetAction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009071-CH3) mechanism can be combined with [delegation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Delegation.html) or [closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html) to delegate the responsibility of handling the action to another controller. See below for a code example.

### User Interaction Code Example

```swift
/// Protocol to specify what must be implemented in order to conform to a `LoginViewControllerDelegate`.
protocol LoginViewControllerDelegate: class {
    func loginViewControllerPasswordRecoveryRequested(_ loginViewController: LoginViewController)
}

/// A controller that manages the actions for login and forgot password buttons.
final class LoginViewController: UIViewController {
    
    /// Button that user taps on to perform the login operation
    private let loginButton: UIButton = {
        let button = UIButton()
        /// Here we add the Target-Action mechanism to the button.
        /// We will call the performLogin method when the user taps on the login button and releases the button while their finger is inside the bounds of the button.
        button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(performLogin(_:)), for: .touchUpInside)
        return button
    }()
    
    /// Button that user taps on to perform password recovery operation
    private let forgotPassword: UIButton = {
        let button = UIButton()
        button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(performPasswordRecovery(_:)), for: .touchUpInside)
        return button
    }()
    
    /// Property that represents the actions that can be performed on behalf of this class
    weak var delegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate?
    
    @objc private func performLogin(_ sender: UIButton) {
        /// Logic that performs a login operation goes here
    }
    
    @objc private func performPasswordRecovery(_ sender: UIButton) {
        /// Inform the delegate that this user interaction took place and the forgot password button was pressed.
        /// The class that conforms to this method will actually implement this method
        delegate?.passwordRecoveryRequested(from: sender)
    }
}
```

### Interface Builder

Views designed in the Interface Builder editor are referenced in code via a `IBOutlet` or `IBAction`. For more information, check out [How we use Interface Builder](InterfaceBuilder.md).

### Code Example

```swift
/// A cell that displays information for purchasable products.
final class ProductCell: UITableViewCell {
    
    @IBOutlet private weak var productImageView: UIImageView!
    @IBOutlet private weak var productNameLabel: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet private weak var priceLabel: UILabel!
    
    /// Holds the data and logic needed to populate a `ProductCell`.
    struct ViewModel {
        
        /// The image representation of the corresponding product.
        let image: UIImage?
        
        /// The name of the corresponding product.
        let productName: String
        
        /// The cost of the corresponding product in USD.
        let price: Double
        
        /// The price of the corresponding product formatted as a `String`.
        var formattedPrice: String {
            return NumberFormatter.localizedString(from: NSNumber(value: price), number: .currency)
        }
    }
    
    /// The viewâ€™s view model. Set this value to update the data displayed in the view.
    var viewModel: ViewModel? {
        didSet {
            productImageView.image = viewModel?.image
            productNameLabel.text = viewModel?.productName
            priceLabel.text = viewModel?.formattedPrice
        }
    }
}
```
