# Custom Operators
### When do we use them?
Custom operators should be avoided. Custom operators can reduce the readability of the code because there can be confusion around their functionality.

### Key Considerations
* Overloading of operators should be used sparingly 
	* e.g. protocol conformance such as `Equatable` or  when two objects are backed by a numeric value such as `Price`

* If there was a need for custom operators, they should be placed in an extension on the `Type` they operate on

* Be sure to refer to our [Extensions](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-style-guide/blob/master/Extensions.md) document when deciding how to name the extension.
