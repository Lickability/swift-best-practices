# Custom Operators
### When do we use them?
Custom operators should be avoided. Custom operators can reduce the readability of the code because there can be confusion around its functionally.

### Key Considerations
* Overloading of operators should be used sparingly 
	* i. e. protocol conformance such as `equatable` or  when two objects are backed by a numeric value such as `price`
