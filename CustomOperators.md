# Custom Operators
### When do we use them?
Custom operators should be avoided. Custom operators can reduce the readability of the code because there can be confusion around their functionality.

### Key Considerations
* Overloading of operators should be used sparingly 
	* e.g. protocol conformance such as `Equatable` or  when two objects are backed by a numeric value such as `Price`
