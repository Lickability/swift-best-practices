# Protocols
### How Do We Use Protocols?
Protocols allow us to define a clear and concise responsibility API that we want to share common traits

### Key Considerations
* Protocols are good for testing because they allow objects to be mocked
* Used for dependency injection allowing the clients to configure their depending implementation
* Provides a layer over third-party dependencies to make refactoring implementations easier
* Allows us to treat or operate on distinct types that we want to share common traits
