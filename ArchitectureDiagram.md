### Model
*Model*s are responsible for representing the data of the application.

### View
*View*s are responsible for rendering content and handling user interaction with that content.

### Controller
*Controller*s are the primary connection between *Model*s, *ViewModel*s, and *View*s.

### ViewModel
A *ViewModel* is a *View*â€™s model. It encapsulates the data needed to populate a particular kind of view and the presentation logic needed to transform the data into properties that can be rendered.
