### Model
Models are responsible for representing the data of the application.

### View
Views are responsible for rendering content and handling user interaction with that content.

### Controller
Controllers are the primary connection between models, view models, and views.

### View Model
A view model is a viewâ€™s model. It encapsulates the data needed to populate a particular kind of view and the presentation logic needed to transform that data into properties that can be rendered.
