### [Model](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-style-guide/blob/master/Model.md)
Models are responsible for representing the data of the application.

### [View](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-style-guide/blob/master/View.md)
Views are responsible for rendering content and handling user interaction with that content.

### [Controller](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-style-guide/blob/master/Controller.md)
Controllers are the primary connection between models, view models, and views.

### [View Model](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-style-guide/blob/master/ViewModel.md)
A view model is a viewâ€™s model. It encapsulates the data needed to populate a particular kind of view and the presentation logic needed to transform that data into properties that can be rendered.
